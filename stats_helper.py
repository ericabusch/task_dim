def false_discovery_control(ps, *, axis=0, method='bh'):
    """Adjust p-values to control the false discovery rate.

    The false discovery rate (FDR) is the expected proportion of rejected null
    hypotheses that are actually true.
    If the null hypothesis is rejected when the *adjusted* p-value falls below
    a specified level, the false discovery rate is controlled at that level.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ps : 1D array_like
        The p-values to adjust. Elements must be real numbers between 0 and 1.
    axis : int
        The axis along which to perform the adjustment. The adjustment is
        performed independently along each axis-slice. If `axis` is None, `ps`
        is raveled before performing the adjustment.
    method : {'bh', 'by'}
        The false discovery rate control procedure to apply: ``'bh'`` is for
        Benjamini-Hochberg [1]_ (Eq. 1), ``'by'`` is for Benjaminini-Yekutieli
        [2]_ (Theorem 1.3). The latter is more conservative, but it is
        guaranteed to control the FDR even when the p-values are not from
        independent tests.

    Returns
    -------
    ps_adusted : array_like
        The adjusted p-values. If the null hypothesis is rejected where these
        fall below a specified level, the false discovery rate is controlled
        at that level.
